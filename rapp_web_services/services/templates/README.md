RAPP Platform Web Services Templates
-------------------------------------

## Synopsis

Use these templates/examples as the ground-truth to develop and/or extend RAPP Platform Web Services (a.k.a HOP Web Services).

If you are not familiar with server-side applications, you might also have to read on [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Templates

To make development of HOP Web Services more attractive and understandable, we provide two template source files:

- web_service_basic.template.js
- web_service_upload_file.template.js

Using these templates as a reference while developing HOP Web Services, might save you alot of hours studying!
In most cases, you might have to change just a few lines of code!

#### web_service_basic.template.js

Illustrates a web-service implementation with, multiple input arguments, ROS interface


#### web_service_upload_file.template.js

Illustrates a web-service implementation that accepts and handles file uploads.
